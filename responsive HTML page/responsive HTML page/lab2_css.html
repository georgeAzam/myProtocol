                Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language[a] for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
                It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
                Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
                HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.
                HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. 
                HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items.

            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
                CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.
                This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
                Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice, and on Braille-based tactile devices.

                JavaScript  often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third party libraries.
                All major web broswers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on user's devices. JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
                It is a multi-paradigm, supporting event driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has applicatoin programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

                PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared towards web development. It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1993 and released in 1995. The PHP reference implementation is now produced by the PHP Group. PHP was originally an abbreviation of Personal Home Page, but it now stands for the recursive acronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.
                PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon or a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code—which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data—would form the whole or part of an HTTP response.
                Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist that can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response.
